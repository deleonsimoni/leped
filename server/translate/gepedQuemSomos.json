        "content": "We are the Studies and Research on Didactics and Teacher Education Group (Grupo de Estudos e Pesquisas em Didática e Formação de Professores), associated to the homonymous Laboratory, of the UFRJ Education College. We exist since 2009,admission year of professor Giseli Barreto da Cruz to UFRJ, founder and current group coordinator. Since then, we have produced research intertwined with education and extension, aiming at the production of knowledges arising from teaching actings and knowings which contribute to the teacher’s professional development. The teacher education we defend is that which is committed to social justice (Zeichner, 2008), seeking not only to recognize cultural differences and to be critical to the evidences of social inequalities, but to effectively think how the pedagogical practices are oriented in the sense of facing and reducing such inequalities, creating opportunities for significative learnings situated in the specific cultural contexts where they occur. The education we defend and seek to translate via our actions evokes the autonomy of teachers who, in the movement of “walking towards themselves” (Josso, 2010), reflect on their experiences and produce knowledges over their practices, articulating them with educational theories through processes of investigation and collaboration in their workplaces. This research network is composed of professors and researchers from the University (undergraduates and graduates) and the Basic Education School in different stages of their academic-professional trajectory."
